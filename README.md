### Hi, how are you? 🦄
<p>My name is Marcos Neto, born in 1995 and currently live in Aracaju, SE - Brasil.</p>

<p>👨‍💻 My first contact with programming was at the university in 2014 and I have been in a serious relationship with front-end development since 2019.</p>

<p>I currently work on technologies: ReactJS, GraphQL, HTML & CSS. In addition to these, I am learning to perform tests in JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>

<p>In addition to writing colorful words, my favorite hobbies are: listening to music (of all the rhythms that you can imagine) and creating choreographies for each one 💃🏿</p>
