### Hi, how are you? 🦄
<p>My name is <strong>Marcos Neto</strong>, born in 1995 and currently live in <strong>Aracaju, SE - Brasil.</strong></p>

<p>👨‍💻 My first contact with programming was at the university (UFS) in 2014 and I have been in a serious relationship with front-end development since 2019.</p>

<p>I currently work on technologies: <strong>ReactJS, GraphQL, HTML & CSS</strong>. In addition to these, I am learning to perform <strong>tests in JavaScript and TypeScript.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to writing colorful words, my favorite hobbies are: listening to music (of all the rhythms that you can imagine) and creating choreographies for each one 💃🏿</p>
